# MiniMax
This code is an extension to the tic-tac-toe assignment for the "COMSM0103: Object Oriented Programming With Java" course at the University of Bristol (UK). You can find a short description of the algorithm below.

This project implements Minimax AI to play the tic-tac-toe game against the computer. The depth of the search in the game tree decreases along with the stage of the game, so that unnecessary branches don't have to be considered.
