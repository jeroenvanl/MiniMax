# MiniMax
This code is an extension to the tic-tac-toe assignment for the "COMSM0103: Object Oriented Programming With Java" course at the University of Bristol (UK). You can find a short description of the algorithm below.

This project implements Minimax AI to play the tic-tac-toe game against the computer. The search-depth decreases along with the stage of the game, so that unneccesary branches don't have to be considered.
